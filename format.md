# Format

Please insert your fields as you need them (not too much, though) – the format is still up for consideration.

* `toaq` – the Toaq word or phrase in question
* `type` – part of speech
* `english` – definition in English
* `gloss` – gloss in English
* `frame` – frame definition, if known; `null` means that the word doesn't have a set frame (possibly anaphoric)
* `namesake` – whether this word is the name used to refer to its frametype

`tools/normalize.js` is for normalizing the dictionary file.
